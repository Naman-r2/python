# Python Generators Examples

# Example 1: Simple generator to yield squares of numbers
def squares(n):
    """Generator that yields squares of numbers from 0 to n-1."""
    for i in range(n):
        yield i ** 2

print("Squares using generator:")
for num in squares(3):
    print(num)

# Example 2: Using next() with a generator
gen = squares(3)
print("\nUsing next() with generator:")
print(next(gen))  # Output: 0
print(next(gen))  # Output: 1
print(next(gen))  # Output: 4

# Example 3: Another simple generator
def my_generator():
    yield 1
    yield 2
    yield 3

gen = my_generator()
print("\nValues from my_generator:")
print(next(gen))  # Output: 1

for val in gen:
    print(val)    # Output: 2, then 3

# Example 4: Reading large files efficiently using a generator
def read_large_file(file_path):
    """Generator to read a file line by line."""
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        for line in file:
            yield line

# Usage example (uncomment the lines below to use with your own file)
# file_path = 'k.txt'
# print("\nReading file line by line:")
# for line in read_large_file(file_path):
#     print(line.strip())
